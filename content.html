        <p>Hi! I honestly don't know how to start this kasi galing tayo sa away pero isasantabi ko muna yon. It was so insensitive of me to tell you those things, sinaabi ko yon without considering kung ano ma ffeel mo. You didn't deserve it.
          Love isn't always pretty, I know minsan umaabot tayo sa point na nagkaka sakitan at nagkakabatuhan ng masasakit na salita.
          I'm sorry kung immature man ako minsan. Hindi ko sinasadyang masaktan ka bebi, please remember this everytime na mag karon man tayo ng away, 
          no matter what comes our way, I will never stop loving you you're the only person that gave me feelings that nobody has ever given me. You're the only one that have 
          the ability to make everything okay even if it's not and I am beyond lucky to have you my love. You're my favorite person, my home, my bestfriend, my honeybunchsugarpie, my-- jk
          hahaba na naman ih HAHAHA pero ayon thank you for showing me what's the real meaning of love. Thank you for letting me feel what genuine love is. Thank you for being my rock, my cheerleader and my forever bff.
          Thank you for helping me to calm down during the roughest of storms, no one knows how to comfort me like you do. Thank you so much for not getting tired listening lots of my stories. Thank you for sticking up with me
          and keep taking care of me even I was hard to handle. I want to thank you for endless things you do for me.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I will choose you on the best days, on the worst nights, in the instsances we almost forget how beatiful our connection is.
          I don't just want to be you girlfriend, I want to be your bestfriend too, I wanna make you genuinely happy.
          I can't promise you a perfect relationship because there will be fights and arguments kagaya nga ng sabi ko I will never stop loving you, I'll love you forever bebiii. Please forgive me kung nasaktan na naman kita.
          Sana mangibabaw parin pagmamahal mo para sakin.Lets grow up together pero syempre andun parin yung individuality, we commit mistakes and get too immature but please stay with me and let's help each other to become better versions
          of ourself. Habang tumatagal I'm starting to hate distance too, umiikli pasensya ko sa mga araw na hindi tayo magkasama. Sobrang hirap pala lalo kapag nag ccrave ka sa presence nung tao.
          Pero kaya naman natin to diba? di naman ganon kalayo dubai at abu dhabi. I'm not dating you para lang maging boyfriend ko, may end goal din ako para satin, you are now part of my motivation to strive and be better at hindi para maging panindaliang babae lang sa buhay mo, 
          I'm looking to the future towards you, no doubts and worries na piliin ka sa araw araw, sure ako simula ng pinili kita, alam ko I'm on the track dahil hindi na ko interesado kumilala pa ng iba.
          I hope your feeling the same as well bebi. I love you so much AMIR ELIEZER DIZOR MACABATAS. Happy 1st motmot :P
